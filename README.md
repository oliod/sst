Before you engage in a PhD programme, you must assemble and submit an admission file using the ADMISSION area of the interface. Your application file requires the following points: 
the required entry qualifications
a supervisor who has agreed to oversee your work
an original and innovative research project in which you have a keen interest
a proposed supervisory panel willing to support you
a proposed doctoral training programme
a way of funding your research

Your submitted admission file will be forwarded to the PhD commission (CDD) responsible for your field of study. 
Please visit the site Special provisions, where you will find specific information needed to assemble and submit your application for admission. 
Applications can be submitted any time during the academic year and will be reviewed at the next CDD meeting.
